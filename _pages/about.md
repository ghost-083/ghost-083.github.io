 <p align="justify"> 
I am Ferdous, a PhD student in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at The Ohio State University and advised by <a href="https://mae.osu.edu/people/hoelzle.1">Professor David Hoelzle</a>. My research is at the intersection of machine learning/reinforcement learning, control and optimization. I am developing algorithms that can work on environments with extremely expensive data (i.e. autonomous manufacturing where samples are expensive due to monetary and time cost). Previously we have shown that <a href="https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-abstract/MSEC2020/84263/V002T07A009/1095697">reinforcement learning can be a good candidate to tackle learning in such systems</a>. Later we developed <a href=" ">PRLAM framework that can effectively learn to manufacture desired acoustic metamaterial using only 50 samples</a>. Currently we are working on the improvement and generalization of this algorithm. We also won the best paper award at <a href="https://event.asme.org/MSEC-2020"> MSEC 2020 </a>.

Here are couple of facts about me, 
* <p align="justify">I wish that someday I will work on developing hierarchical reinforcement learning and control algorithms that can help building autonomous systems capable of performing high level abstract tasks </p>    
* <p align="justify">I am deeply motivated to leverage physics based knowledge in Machine Learning for robust decision making, many mature fields can benefit from using domain specific knowledge in learning algorithms </p>   
* <p align="justify"> I plan to broaden my activity against environmental pollution in [my home country](https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/environment-pollution-in-dhaka-bangladesh-18000-died-world-bank-report-1634566){:target="_blank"} </p>

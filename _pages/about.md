I am Ferdous, a PhD student in the Mechanical and Aerospace Department at The Ohio State University and advised by [Professor David Hoelzle](https://mae.osu.edu/people/hoelzle.1). My research is at the intersection of machine learning/reinforcement learning, control and optimization. I am developing algorithms that can work on environments with extremely expensive data (i.e. autonomous manufacturing where samples are expensive due to monetary and time cost). Previously we have shown that [reinforcement learning can be a good candidate to tackle learning in such systems](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/MSEC/proceedings-abstract/MSEC2020/84263/V002T07A009/1095697). Later we developed [PRLAM framework that can effectively learn to manufacture desired acoustic metamaterial using only 50 samples](). Currently we are working on the improvement and generalization of this algorithm. We also won the best paper award at [MSEC 2020](https://event.asme.org/MSEC-2020). Here are couple of things about me, 
* I wish that someday I will work on developing hierarchial reinforcement learning and control algorithms that can help building autonomous systems capable of performing high level abstract tasks    
* I wish to actively work against environmental pollution in [my home country](https://www.thedailystar.net/environment/environment-pollution-in-dhaka-bangladesh-18000-died-world-bank-report-1634566)
